# ChemScreen User Guide

## Welcome to ChemScreen

ChemScreen is a powerful tool designed to help librarians and regulatory professionals quickly screen large batches of chemicals for literature evidence. Instead of manually searching for each chemical one-by-one (which can take 2-3 days for 50-100 chemicals), ChemScreen automates the process and completes the same work in 2-3 hours.

## Quick Start

### What You Need

- A CSV file with your chemical names and CAS numbers
- 5-10 minutes to upload and configure your search
- An internet connection for PubMed searches

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload** your chemical list
2. **Configure** search parameters
3. **Start** the automated search
4. **Review** results and quality scores
5. **Export** formatted reports

Let's walk through each step in detail.

## Step 1: Preparing Your Chemical List

### File Format

ChemScreen accepts CSV (comma-separated values) files with the following format:

```csv
Chemical Name,CAS Number
Caffeine,58-08-2
Aspirin,50-78-2
Glucose,50-99-7
Benzene,71-43-2
```

### Required Information

- **Chemical Name** (required): Common name, IUPAC name, or trade name
- **CAS Number** (optional but recommended): Chemical Abstracts Service registry number

### Creating Your CSV File

**From Excel**:
1. Create two columns: "Chemical Name" and "CAS Number"
2. Enter your chemicals (one per row)
3. Save as "CSV (Comma delimited)" format

**From Google Sheets**:
1. Create your chemical list in the same format
2. File ‚Üí Download ‚Üí Comma-separated values (.csv)

**Tips for Better Results**:
- ‚úÖ Use standard chemical names when possible
- ‚úÖ Include CAS numbers for accuracy
- ‚úÖ Check spelling of chemical names
- ‚úÖ One chemical per row
- ‚ùå Avoid special characters in chemical names
- ‚ùå Don't include extra columns (ChemScreen uses first two columns only)

### File Size Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 10 MB
- **Recommended batch size**: 25-100 chemicals
- **For larger lists**: Split into multiple files for better performance

## Step 2: Uploading Your File

### Upload Process

1. **Drag and drop** your CSV file onto the upload area, or
2. **Click "Browse files"** to select your file

### File Preview

After uploading, ChemScreen will show you a preview of your chemicals:
- **Chemical names** as they will be searched
- **CAS numbers** (if provided)
- **Validation status** for each entry

### Common Upload Issues

#### File format not supported

- Ensure your file is saved as .csv format
- Try re-saving from Excel as "CSV (Comma delimited)"

#### File too large

- Split large lists into smaller batches (50-100 chemicals per file)
- Remove unnecessary columns

#### No chemicals detected

- Check that your first row contains headers
- Ensure chemical names are in the first column

## Step 3: Configuring Search Parameters

### Search Parameters

**Date Range** (Default: 10 years)
- How far back to search for publications
- Options: 3, 5, 10, 15, or 20 years
- *Recommendation*: Use 10 years for comprehensive screening

**Include Review Articles** (Default: Yes)
- Whether to include review articles in results
- Reviews often provide comprehensive overviews
- *Recommendation*: Include reviews for complete picture

**Maximum Results per Chemical** (Default: 100)
- Limits the number of publications retrieved per chemical
- Higher numbers = more comprehensive but slower
- *Recommendation*: 50-100 for most regulatory work

**Use Cache** (Default: Yes)
- Speeds up repeat searches by saving previous results
- No impact on result quality
- *Recommendation*: Always keep enabled

### Advanced Settings

Click "Advanced Options" to access additional settings:

**Search Strategy**:
- **Comprehensive**: Searches chemical name, CAS number, and common synonyms
- **Targeted**: Searches only provided name and CAS number
- **Broad**: Includes trade names and alternative spellings

**Quality Filters**:
- **Minimum publication year**: Exclude very old publications
- **Journal quality filter**: Focus on peer-reviewed journals
- **Language filter**: English-only or all languages

## Step 4: Running Your Search

### Starting the Search

1. Review your uploaded chemicals in the preview
2. Adjust search parameters if needed
3. Click **"Start Literature Search"**

### Monitoring Progress

ChemScreen will show real-time progress:
- **Progress bar**: Overall completion percentage
- **Current chemical**: Which chemical is being searched
- **Status updates**: Search progress and any issues
- **Time estimate**: Approximate time remaining

### What Happens During Search

For each chemical, ChemScreen:

1. Builds optimized PubMed search queries
2. Retrieves publication lists from PubMed
3. Calculates quality scores and metrics
4. Caches results for future use

### Expected Timing

- **10 chemicals**: 2-5 minutes
- **50 chemicals**: 10-20 minutes
- **100 chemicals**: 20-40 minutes

*Note: Times depend on internet speed and PubMed responsiveness*

### If Something Goes Wrong
- **Slow progress**: Normal for large batches; PubMed rate limits apply
- **Individual chemical errors**: ChemScreen will note these and continue
- **Complete failure**: Check internet connection and try smaller batches

## Step 5: Understanding Your Results

### Results Overview
After completion, you'll see a summary table with:
- **Chemical Name**: As searched

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How accurate are the search results?**
A: ChemScreen uses the same PubMed database that librarians search manually. Results are as comprehensive as manual searching but much faster. Quality scores help identify chemicals that may need additional manual verification.

**Q: Can I search for trade names or synonyms?**
A: Yes, ChemScreen includes common synonyms in its searches. For best results, provide the most common or official chemical name. You can also upload multiple entries for the same chemical with different names.

**Q: How current are the search results?**
A: ChemScreen searches the live PubMed database, so results include publications up to the current date. The database is updated daily by the National Library of Medicine.

**Q: What if I need to search other databases besides PubMed?**
A: ChemScreen currently focuses on PubMed, which contains the majority of biomedical and life sciences literature. For specialized databases (e.g., toxicology, environmental), use ChemScreen results as a starting point and supplement with targeted manual searches.

**Q: Can I save my search parameters for future use?**
A: Yes, ChemScreen remembers your last-used parameters. For consistent workflows, document your standard parameters and use them across similar projects.

**Q: How long are results cached?**
A: Cache entries are stored for 1 hour by default. This means repeat searches for the same chemicals with identical parameters will be much faster.

**Q: Can multiple people use the same ChemScreen instance?**
A: Yes, ChemScreen can be accessed by multiple users simultaneously. Each user's session is independent, so you won't interfere with others' searches.

**Q: What should I do if a chemical returns no results?**
A: This can happen with very new chemicals, specialized industrial chemicals, or misspelled names. Try alternative names, check spelling, or consider that some chemicals genuinely have limited published literature.
